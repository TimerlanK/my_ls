## My_ls
For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, my_ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, my_ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.
If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.
